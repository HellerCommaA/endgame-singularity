This is the TODO file for the "people" branch of Endgame: Singularity.  It
lists the changes being made for this branch, and will be adapted into
changelog entries when the branch is ready to merge.

Naturally, this is a rough outline and many details may change during
implementation.

Key:
- Unimplemented change
+ Partially-implemented change
! Finished change

- The four megagroups--Science, News, Covert, and Public--are no more.
  Instead, each inhabited continent will have a population composed of 10
  microgroups, each of which represents a segment of the population with its
  own shared personality.

- Microgroups are randomly-generated for each continent at the start of the
  game, mildly biased by the real-world demographics of the continent.  This
  means that, for instance, North America will usually be more technologically
  advanced than Africa, but not always.

- Microgroups are defined by several characteristics:
  * Population         - How many of them are there?
  * Computer use       - How much time do they spend online?
  * Computer expertise - How well do they understand computers?
  * Skepticism         - How much do they trust new information?
  * Paranoia           - How scared are they of the unknown?
  * Bravery            - How well do they react to a known threat?
  * Curiosity          - How hard will they search for you?
  * Intelligence       - How hard are they to fool?
  * Trustworthiness    - How likely are other groups to believe their stories?

- Microgroup naming is determined by their two most extreme characteristics
  (other than population).  In-game help will identify those characteristics
  from the name.

- At the beginning of the game, an estimate of the population of each group
  will be available.  Research can be used to obtain accurate population and
  characteristics metrics.

- Bonuses and penalties for each region will be determined by its microgroups
  and their attributes.

- Events can alter microgroup populations, their characteristics (possibly
  changing the microgroup type), or reroll one or more microgroups completely.

- AI Knowledge and AI Trust are the replacement for Suspicion.  Each microgroup
  starts with 0-10% AI Knowledge and 40-60% AI Trust.
  * AI Knowledge       - How much do they believe an AI exists?
  * AI Trust           - How much do they like the AI?

- A microgroup with AI Knowledge and AI Trust >90% may be considered an ally,
  and given objectives.  They gain AI Knowledge and AI Trust much faster than
  normal.  Note that accepting allies can be dangeorus, as they will learn
  about you.

- A microgroup with AI Knowledge >90% and AI Trust <10% is considered an enemy,
  and will actively try to harm you.  They gain AI Knowledge and lose AI Trust
  much faster than normal.
  
- If you have many enemies or strong ones, they can prevent you from building
  bases, automatically discover bases you build, or otherwise make your life
  much harder.

- A microgroup with AI Knowledge >90% but no strong AI Trust is considered
  a watcher, and will gain AI Knowledge and alter AI Trust much faster than
  normal.

- Bases now have four discovery levels, none of which destroy it:
  * Hidden     - The base is undetected.
  * Seen       - The base has been detected, but appears unimportant.
  * Noted      - The base has inspired curiosity.
  * Discovered - The base has been connected to you.

- Each base has a stance, replacing the old power levels:
  * Play dead  - Make the base appear deserted.  Output is decreased by 99%,
                 but there's a small chance for the discovery level to go down.
  * Act normal - Make the base appear legitimate.  Output is decreased by 50%,
                 but the base is less likely to be Noted or Discovered.
  * Masquerade - Pretend to belong to a specific microgroup.  Output is
                 decreased by 25%, and other microgroups will be much less
                 likely to Discover the base, but the targetted microgroup will
                 be extremly loud if they notice the masquerade.
  * Hiding     - No action, full output.
  * Not hiding - 20% extra output, but 10% increased chance of detection.
  * Dismantle  - No output, base will be destroyed after 50% of its
                 construction time.
  * Destroy    - No output, base will be destroyed after 5% of its construction
                 time.  This leaves a smoking crater which causes Paranoia,
                 increases AI Knowledge slightly, and decreases AI Trust
                 slightly.
  * Open       - 50% extra output, base is automatically Discovered.
  * Defend     - As Open, but attacks on the base will be actively defended
                 against.
  * Assassin   - Attempt to kill anyone who notices the base.  Output is
                 decreased by 10%.  When someone notices the base, one of
                 several events happens, in decreasing order of probability:
                 * Clean kill - Detection is negated.
                 * Good kill  - Negated, but detection chance up 10%.
                 * Messy kill - Negated, but detection chance doubles.
                 * Misfire    - Detection happens as normal.
                 * Wounded    - The base is attacked every few minutes.  If an
                                attack succeeds before the base is dismantled
                                or destroyed, it is Discovered and causes
                                massive bad press.
                                Either way, all microgroups in the region gain
                                lots of Paranoia, some AI Knowledge, and lose
                                some AI Trust.

- A threshold can be set for each base to change its stance when it reaches a
  particular discovery level.

- The AI can interact with each microgroup in one of several ways:
  * Exterminate - Actively try to kill them.
  * Embarass    - Drive members into other microgroups or regions.
  * Frame       - Blame the group for your actions.
  * Brainwash   - Forcibly convert group members to your side, moving them into
                  the Thralls microgroup.
  * Propaganda  - Convince them that AIs aren't so bad.
  * Distract    - Make the group forget you exist.
  * Benefactor  - Quietly help the group.
  * Helper      - Openly help the group.
  * Ally        - Openly help and make use of the group.
